## 🎯 Debt Avalanche Explained

The Debt Avalanche method prioritizes paying off debts with the highest interest rates first:

1. **List all debts** with their interest rates
2. **Sort by interest rate** (highest first)
3. **Pay minimum** on all debts
4. **Extra money** goes to highest interest debt
5. **Once paid off**, move to next highest
6. **Repeat** until debt-free

**Why it works:** Saves the most money on interest charges!
